# Tic-Tac-Toe
And it came to pass that a game was created, a simple game of noughts and crosses, known by many as tic-tac-toe.

# How to Play
The game is simple: two players take turns marking squares on a 3x3 grid, with the first player using 'X' and the second player using 'O'. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If the board is full and no player has won, the game is a tie.

To play the game, run the play_tic_tac_toe function from the command line. You will be prompted to enter your move as a row and column separated by a space. The computer will make its move automatically. The game will continue until one player wins or the game is a tie.
